Having explored various opportunities, it was decided to join the non-profit organisation, Zero to Five, in its drive to provide food, blankets and other essentials to areas worst affected.  Zero to Five has a long-standing reputation of driving early childhood nutrition programmes and early childhood development centres in disadvantaged communities and are well connected with the communities affected by the floods.  We believe supporting them for our company-wide Nelson Mandela Day initiative is an effective way to help rebuild the devastated province in terms of feeding our vulnerable children.
